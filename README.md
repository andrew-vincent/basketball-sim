Creating a basic simulator of Boston Celtics games

The current simultor file (V3) takes in data from CSVs that were manually aggregated. It only models the number of shots taken and outputs all of the shots by Celtics in a simulated game and the final score. It is being expanded to include more factors such as lineups, rebounds, turnovers, shot clock, etc.

The other file is an example of extracting play-by-play data from basketball-reference.com to get distributions for how quickly events happen in game and to use that extracted data to model factors more accurately and across the league.

The overall goal of this project is to make a simulator with inputs that can be adjusted and optimized such as player lineups, player load, shot distribution strategy, etc.
